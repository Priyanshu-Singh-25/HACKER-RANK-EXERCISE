//Problem

        /*This New Year, Sharib (an experienced event planner) is planning a celebration and needs your help to determine if they can host it within their budget. Sharib has a list of expenses for different activities and items, along with specific conditions for hosting the celebration. Write a program to evaluate whether Sharib can host the celebration or not.
        
        Conditions to Host the Celebration:
        
        The total cost of the celebration must not exceed the budget.
        The number of guests must be greater than 5 and less than or equal to 50.
        At least one of the following conditions must hold:
        The decoration cost is less than 30% of the budget.
        The total food cost is less than 50% of the budget.
        If the number of guests exceeds 25, there must be a music arrangement (i.e., musicCost > 0).
        Input Format
        
        The input consists of six integers:
        
        budget: Total budget for the celebration (in dollars).
        numGuests: Number of guests invited.
        foodCostPerGuest: Cost of food per guest (in dollars).
        decorationCost: Cost of decorations (in dollars).
        musicCost: Cost of hiring a DJ or music system (in dollars).
        extraExpenses: Additional expenses for the celebration (in dollars).
        Constraints
        
        1 ≤ budget ≤ 10^4
        1 ≤ numGuests ≤ 100
        1 ≤ foodCostPerGuest ≤ 10^4
        0 ≤ decorationCost ≤ 10^4
        0 ≤ musicCost ≤ 10^4
        0 ≤ extraExpenses ≤ 10^4
        Output Format
        
        Output a single line:
        
        "Celebration Approved" if Sharib can host the celebration within the given conditions.
        "Celebration Denied" otherwise.
