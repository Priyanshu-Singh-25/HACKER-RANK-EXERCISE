//Problem

      /*Given a positive integer n, find the sum of all integers from 1 to n (inclusive) that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7.
      
      You must print the result, not return it.
      
      Input Format
      
      A single integer input: n
      
      Constraints
      
      1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 10^3
      Output Format
      
      Print a single integer — the sum of all numbers in the given range divisible by 3, 5, or 7
      
      Sample Input 0
      
      7
      Sample Output 0
      
      21
      Explanation 0
